# Boruta OAuth/OpenID Connect provider core

Boruta is the core of an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider implementing according business rules. This library also provides a generator to create phoenix controllers, views and templates to have a basic provider up and running.

As it, a provider implemented using Boruta aim to follow RFCs:
- [RFC 6749 - The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)
- [RFC 7662 - OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662)
- [RFC 7009 - OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009)
- [RFC 7636 - Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)
- [RFC 7521 - Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7521)
- [RFC 7523 - JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523)

And specification from OpenID Foundation:
- [OpenID Connect core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)
- [OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 incorporating errata set 1](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html)

This package is meant to help to bring authorization into Elixir applications. With it, you can perform part or all of authorization code, implicit, hybrid, client credentials, or resource owner password credentials grants flows. It also helps introspecting and revoking tokens.
